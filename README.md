Handle errors
If a user navigates to a non-existent route, or if a request for a resource fails for whatever reason, your app should handle the error in a user friendly way.
Add an error handler to app.js that sets the error message to a user friendly message, and sets the status code.
Log out a user friendly message to the console when the app is pointed at a URL that doesn't exist as a route in the app, such as /error/error.
Refer to the video on Error handling Middleware, which is linked in the project resources list.
Complete your Pug files
Go through each of the four Pug templates to inject your data. The Pug files contain comments that detail each change you will need to make. You can and should delete these comments when you are finished with this step. But you should wait to do so until everything is working as it should, in case you need to refer to these notes during development.
Leave the example HTML files in your project so your reviewer can reference them.
Layout, CSS and styles
The layout of the finished project should match the provided mockups.
To really make this project your own, you should customize the CSS following the suggestions in the Extra Credit section at the bottom of this page.
Add good code comments
Check for cross-browser consistency
Review the "How you'll be graded" section
