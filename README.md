# treehouse_unit7_exceeds

Ryan Emslie
This is my attempt for the Unit 7 Exceeds Expectation


Changes
  I included a background.css file that includes the majority of the CSS changes that I made.

-Notes:
  The only code that I copied from another source was the 

  if (app.get("env") === "development")

  located in the app.js file.  I need am not fully up to speed on the env property.
